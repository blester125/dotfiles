# Utils

Collection of tools I use during development.

They are mostly small tools to use in python3 scripts.

 * `colors.py` Print in colors using ANSI codes.
 * `log.py` Log in color.
 * `partialclass.py` Partial Applications applied to class `__init__`s
 * `fork_pdb.py` A wrapper around `pdb` that can attach to forked processes
